# Flappy-Bird-Neural-Network
A unity project creating a spin-off of flappy bird with Coronavirus and Mr Worldwide.
A Neural Network with the genetic algorithm was also incorporated without the use of any libraries.

Here the neural network can be seen working as another generation improves from the last.


## What I got from this project
- Improved my OO language skills using C# to control the game logic
- The fundamentals of game development on an incredibly popular engine, Unity
- The confidence to be able to learn something to a good level within a short time frame
- Optimising code so that it works when the objective changes
- Solidifying my knowledge on Neural Networks and learn the basis of the genetic algorithm 
- Having lots of fun with my coding and making a game that my mates and I loved :)
